# React Native Asynchronous State Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access state variables before they've been initialized, often due to asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The issue arises when accessing state variables within a component before an asynchronous operation (e.g., a network request) that updates the state has completed.  This usually results in a runtime error because the state variable is still `null` or `undefined`.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling the asynchronous operation and conditionally rendering UI elements based on the state's availability. This is typically done by checking for `null` or `undefined` values before attempting to access properties of the state variable, or by using optional chaining (?.)
