This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when using asynchronous operations within the component's lifecycle methods. For example, consider this component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error happens here */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The `Text` component tries to access `data.someProperty` before the `fetchData` function has completed and updated the `data` state variable.  This results in `data` being `null` and the application crashing.

Another scenario is that you are accessing data which is not yet available in a certain phase of the lifecycle of the application.
